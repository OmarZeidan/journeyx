## Roadmap

- [x] Running and working app with base++ requirements.
- [ ] Add a toast message to relfect CRUD operations.
- [ ] Add more tests.
- [ ] Add Sentry.
- [ ] Add Authentication with [Clerk](https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/vue).
- [ ] Some cleanup if necessary for `<TourForm />`, things like validation and think of more composables.
- [ ] For more fun, add [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started).
- [ ] Debounce on Search? (It would be more valuable if we are calling APIs tho)

## Q&A

1. Why not using Pinia?

Pinia is a powerful option, but it might be overkill for a small app. For simpler state sharing, using a global state can be more efficient than passing props or relying on Vue's provide and inject.

2. Why using an Input for Driver's location, and a dropdown list for Tour?

I used an input field for the Driver's location to easily validate that no numbers are entered, which isn't possible on a predefined dropdown.
